# VGA graphics

VGA controller and basic graphics generator. Outputs 640x480@60fps VGA signal.

Needs a 25MHz clock, I used a PLL clock setup generated by the IP clock wizard found in Xilinx software. 

This was tested on a Zedboard FPGA dev board. The constraints file matches to the Zedboard pins. Input by DIP switches, output by VGA connector.
